# Allergo-FM-application-for-materials-property
apply Allergo foundation model for differnerer materials properties analysis 

Outline of project:
1. Introduction and Background:
   - This project aims to use foundation model for materials research and molecular dynamics.
   - We aims at exploring Allegro-FM foundation model and also Meta Uma universal model.
2. Project goal
   - Designing and characterizing single-Layer graphene with Allegro-FM, including the effects of target doping.
   - Validating the model's predictions against existing experimental or theoretical data for graphene.
   - Testing optimal dopant types and concentrations.
   - Simulating phenomena at a larger scale, such as defect formation.
3. Methodology
